# **Button Combo Puzzle**

This project of mine showcases a puzzle dealing with one's memory and coordination skills. It involves eight buttons, each with a linked combination to one another.
This is no traditional code lock. Each button needs to be pushed in a certain order. It doesn't matter which button you start from, just know that one button always has to be pressed before and after a specific button.

## **What this showcases**

This project showcases my knowledge of inheritance, linked lists, and basic java swing (GUI). Linked Lists was the primary data structure utilzed in this project. This project consists of a linkled lists build from scratch of a class of ButtonNode. ButtonNode extends JButton which is then used to create a linkedlist of ButtonNode classes. Feel free to navigate to the src file and view the open source of my class files.

Here we have eight buttons. Each of them are unpressed at the moment.

Here after some trial and error. We have found that there is an order from b1 - b3 - b7.

However, we mess up and we have to restart. However, I found out that the button that comes before b1 is b8. So I can go from b8-b1-b3-b7
