# **Button Combo Puzzle**

This project of mine showcases a puzzle dealing with one's memory and coordination skills. It involves eight buttons, each with a linked combination to one another.
This is no traditional code lock. Each button needs to be pushed in a certain order. It doesn't matter which button you start from, just know that one button always has to be pressed before and after a specific button.

## **What this showcases**

This project showcases my knowledge of inheritance, linked lists, and basic java swing (GUI). Linked Lists was the primary data structure utilzed in this project. This project consists of a linkled lists build from scratch of a class of ButtonNode. ButtonNode extends JButton which is then used to create a linkedlist of ButtonNode classes.
