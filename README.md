# **Button Combo Puzzle**

This project of mine showcases a puzzle dealing with one's memory and coordination skills. It involves eight buttons, each with a linked combination to one another.
This is no traditional code lock. Each button needs to be pushed in a certain order. It doesn't matter which button you start from, just know that one button always has
to be pressed before and after a specific button.
